amend stack_snapshot to gazelle_cabal's needs

where should we get base? add it to stack_snapshot, or register as toolchain lib?
if latter, gazelle_cabal generates @stackage//:base which we don't want, we want :base instead
gazelle-update-repos

showcase deleting a component

showcase adding an external dep and using update-repos to update WORKSPACE

many caveats - see the readme for gazelle_cabal



gazelle_haskell_modules
extend stack_snapshot with hspec
add gazelle_haskell_modules deps

extend gazelle_binary with language extension/add

extend docker image with tinfo!!!

showcase deleting a module

showcase autodiscover

mention cross_library_deps and narrowed_deps?

many caveats - see the readme for gazelle_haskell_modules

TODOs from slides

## BUILD File Generation


TODO

* Introduce Gazelle
* For Go
* For Haskell

This doesn't need to go in-depth, but should describe common workflows:

* Adding a module/library dependency
* Removing a module/library
* Adding an exterinal dependency

## Gazelle

Gazelle is a build file generator for Bazel projects.

It supports generating `BUILD.bazel` files from a `go.mod` file, and can also update repository rules for Go dependencies.

You can find it on GitHub at [`bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle).
