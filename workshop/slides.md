# Bazel Workshop

---

## Introduction

---

<!-- header: 'Introduction' -->

The goal of this workshop is to familiarize you with Bazel:
To teach you how to use it effectively as your build system when you're working on your code.

The project you're working on contains components written in different languages: Mainly Haskell and Go. Right now you may still be using the respective native build tools for each of these languages.

---

As we will see today, Bazel offers a few improvements over those:

* It supports large scale projects.
* It supports multiple programming languages.
* It can manage tests and workflows.
* And more...

---

That said, Bazel may take some getting used to, and some of your workflows or tooling may need to be adapted to fit within Bazel.

---

## Setup


The environment for this workshop is provided in a Docker image with Bazel pre-installed which we've provided.
It additionally has some Bazel caches prepopulated, as building any Haskell project from scratch can take a non-trivial amount of time.

Additionally, you must have the accompanying git repository cloned.

To run the image with the example projects mounted you can run
```bash
docker run -v<PATH-TO-REPO>/workshop:/home/jovyan/workshop -it <docker-image> bash
```
where `<PATH-TO-REPO>` is the path in which you cloned the git repository for the workshop.

---

### Bazel basic commands

---

For the rest of the presentation, we will be demonstarting things on the `01_simple` project.

---

<!-- header: 'Bazel basic commands' -->

We can build one or multiple targets in our project using the `bazel build` command.

```bash
bazel build //...
```

`//...` is a pattern for all targets in the repository. We'll introduce patterns and labels in detail later.

---

Bazel is also a test system.

We can ask Bazel to run some or (in this case) all of our tests:

```bash
bazel test //...
```

---

We can also directly run executable targets:

```bash
bazel run //:hello
```

As previously, `//:hello` is the **label** of the executable target.

---

### Relation to the Go compiler, GHC, Cabal, Stack?

How does Bazel relate to the compilers and build tools that you may be familiar with?

---

Bazel provides an abstraction on top of these tools. With Bazel you can define all your build targets, Go, Haskell, or otherwise, in a common language.
Bazel will then invoke the appropriate compilers and tools to build your code.

The way that Bazel knows how to do so is by so called "rulesets" - they implement the logic for calling compilers, linking, and in general anything required to build
a certain language.
They can be either builtin (for example java rules) or written as extension (for example `rules_haskell`).

## Anatomy of a Bazel project

---

<!-- header: 'Anatomy of a Bazel project' -->

Let's analyse the files in our minimal Bazel project, located in `~/workshop/01_simple`.

```bash
> cd ~/workshop/01_simple
> ls -1
BUILD.bazel
Hello.hs
MyLib.hs
Test.hs
WORKSPACE
bazel-01_simple
bazel-bin
bazel-out
bazel-testlogs
```

---

### `WORKSPACE`

Every Bazel project has **one** `WORKSPACE` file. It marks the root of the repository.

It is also where external dependencies are declared. We'll look at this file a bit later.

---

### `bazel-*` ([documentation][output directories])
These are convenience symlinks generated by Bazel.

* `bazel-bin` and `bazel-out` provide access to generated files, e.g. compiled binaries.
  ```bash
  bazel build //:hello
  ls -1 bazel-bin
  ...
  ./bazel-bin/hello
  ...
  ```
* `bazel-testlogs` provides access to test logs.
* `bazel-01_simple` (generally `bazel-<dirname>`) provides access to the "execroot". This is where `bazel run` executes commands.

[output directories]: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/output_directories.html

---

### Source files (e.g. `Hello.hs`)

Your project's source files. These have Bazel labels assigned to them just as targets and generated files do.

E.g. `//:Hello.hs` addresses a source file, while `//:hello` addresses a Haskell binary target.

---

### `BUILD` files

Bazel provides a language to describe build targets and their dependencies.

Let's look at the "BUILD" file for our simple project - `~/workshop/01_simple/BUILD.bazel`.

---

```python
load(
    "@rules_haskell//haskell:defs.bzl",
    "haskell_binary",
    "haskell_library",
    "haskell_test",
    "haskell_toolchain_library",
)

# Define a Haskell library target.
haskell_library(
    name = "mylib",
    srcs = ["MyLib.hs"],
    # By default, Haskell targets depend on `base`, which provides `Prelude`.
    deps = [":base"],
)

# `base` is included in the GHC distribution, it is a "toolchain library".
haskell_toolchain_library(name = "base")

# Define a Haskell executable target.
haskell_binary(
    name = "hello",
    srcs = ["Hello.hs"],
    deps = [
        ":base",
        ":mylib",
    ],
)

# Define a Haskell test target.
haskell_test(
    name = "test",
    size = "small",
    srcs = ["Test.hs"],
    deps = [
        ":base",
    ],
)
```

---

Each BUILD file marks a **package** and describes the **targets** of this package.

The BUILD file we're looking at exists at the top-level, so it marks the package `//`.

A nested BUILD file, e.g. `some/dir/BUILD.bazel`, marks a nested package, e.g. `//some/dir`.

---

Targets in a package are addressed with labels such as `//:hello` or `//some/dir:some-target`.

We will promptly discuss labels in detail.

---

Bazel's configuration language is called Starlark. Its syntax is heavily "inspired" by Python.

BUILD files are meant to be declarative: They declare build targets and their metadata.
As such, BUILD files only allow a subset of Starlark. BUILD files are not meant to contain complex logic.

---

Bazel understands different **kinds** of targets. In this case we see `haskell_library`, `haskell_toolchain_library`, `haskell_binary`, and `haskell_test`.

Each target is usually defined by a **rule**.

So `//:hello` is the label of a target of kind `haskell_binary`, which is defined by the `haskell_binary` rule.

---

While this example only contains Haskell targets, it is completely fine and actually common to have targets for different languages,
along with cross-dependencies between them.
We will see an example with multiple languages later.

## Bazel targets ([documentation][targets])

---

<!-- header: 'Bazel targets' -->

### Labels ([documentation][labels])

---

Labels are names that refer to targets.

Many labels can refer to the same target, but each label refers to at most one target. (i.e. there is a function `Label -> Target`)

The most common label would look something like `@repo//path/to/package:target`. Let's take it apart.

---
**@repo**//path/to/package:target

`repo` refers to the repository we're building.

This is optional and if omitted, defaults to the current repo.

This is useful when we only want to build external dependencies.

---
@repo//**path/to/package**:target

`path/to/package` is the path to the package we're building.

 Spelled out, this is a directory with a path `path/to/package` with a `BUILD` file in it,
 relative to the repository root, marked by the `WORKSPACE` file.

---
@repo**//**path/to/package:target

`//` designates the root of the repository we're building.

 This is optional. If we omit it, Bazel assumes we're referring to a path relative to the current directory, e.g.
 ```bash
 cd path/to
 bazel build package:target
 ```
 does the same thing as
 ```bash
 bazel build //path/to/package:target
 ```

---
@repo//path/to/package:**target**

`target` is the target we want to refer to

 It must be available in the `BUILD` file for the package we're building, i.e. from `path/to/package/BUILD.bazel`

There is some special label syntax, some of which we'll explore in the next section.

---

### `bazel query`ing targets ([tutorial][bazel query how to], [documentation][bazel query])

Bazel provides tools to query the build targets defined in a project, their metadata, and their interdependencies.

---

#### All targets

We can query for all targets in the top-level package.

```bash
bazel query //:all
```

We also saw the `...` target earlier. For our `simple` example, these coincide, but in general, `...` refers to all targets in **all packages** in the workspace.
(In truth, it's a bit more subtle than that. You can read more about targets in the Bazel docs on [targets][targets].)

---

#### All files

We can also query for all ruls **and** all files (source or generated) in the top-level package.

```bash
bazel query //:*
```

---

#### Specific target

Let's query for some details of the `hello` target.

```bash
bazel query //:hello
```

Get the kind

```bash
bazel query //:hello --output label_kind
```

---

#### Querying for dependencies

Query for dependencies


```bash
bazel query 'deps(//:hello)' --noimplicit_deps
```

The `--noimplicit_deps` flag excludes some things which are considered "implicit dependencies",
not specified by the BUILD file but instead added by the Bazel (such as compilers)
We exclude them, since they would heavily obfuscate the result here.

It's documented [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/query-how-to.html#Aside_implicit_dependencies)

---

We can also output a format suitable for consumption by graphviz

```bash
bazel query 'deps(//:hello)' --noimplicit_deps --output graph | dot -Tpng > deps.png
```

---

#### `--output build` ([documentation][output build])

Output information in "the format of a BUILD file".

Useful for seeing the result of expansions and macros.

```bash
bazel query //:hello --output build
```

---

#### Real life query example

Finally, as a small showcase of a more "real" query, here's what I used to precache the Docker image.
```bash
bazel query 'filter(stackage, kind(haskell_.*_library, deps(//:app)))'
```

## Fast and Correct

Bazel's tagline is that it offers fast and correct builds.

It aims to provide fast builds by aggressively caching outputs, parallelizing the build.

It also provides advanced features, like remote execution, to scale to very large projects.

Let's look at Bazel's caching features first.

---

### Caching

---

<!-- header: 'Caching' -->

Bazel has extensive caching features.
* It can keeps track of which targets are affected or unaffected by a change. So it won't rebuild a target that didn't change. This is similar to what tools like `make` provide.
* It can cache build outputs on disk or remotely and re-use them when a previously run action is requested again with the same inputs.

  For example, if you switch to a feature branch and then back to the main branch, then you will not have to rebuild everything from scratch.
* It caches successful test results. So you don't have to rerun a test case if none of its inputs changed.

---

* Run `bazel clean --expunge` to force a rebuild.
* Run `bazel build //:hello --disk_cache=~/.cache/bazel/disk`.
* Change `main` in `Hello.hs`.
* Run `bazel build //:hello --disk_cache=~/.cache/bazel/disk` again.
* Undo the change in `Hello.hs`.
* Run `bazel build //:hello --disk_cache=~/.cache/bazel/disk` once more.

  This time Bazel should use the cached results and print a message about "remote cache hit".

---

### Sandboxing

---

<!-- header: 'Sandboxing' -->

* Caching, parallelism, remote execution rely on **correct** builds. Meaning all dependencies of a target must be declared, so that Bazel knows to build those first.

* Correct builds can be difficult to ensure.
  For example in a system like `make` it is possible to forget to declare a dependency.
  What's worse, build actions might still run successfully because the dependency just happens to already be built before its dependees due to how actions are scheduled.

* Such build descriptions are brittle: Changing parallelism or some other part of the build graph might change this ordering, and suddenly a seemingly unrelated target fails to build.

---

* Bazel strives to enforce correctness by enforcing hermeticity.
  A build must declare all its dependencies, otherwise it will not succeed. It does that by sandboxing build actions and only exposing declared dependencies to a target.

* Note that these mechanisms only operate on the level of sources and artifacts from within the project.
  Bazel, in its default configuration, does not go so far to isolate common system dependencies like system libraries or the C compiler.
  This level of isolation can be achieved, but requires additional setup, e.g. Nix, or sandboxfs, or Docker images.

---

Let's see sandboxing in action.
* Take the `//:hello` target and remove its dependency on `//:mylib` in the BUILD file.
* Try to build the target and see it fail.
* Use the Bazel flags `--subcommands --sandbox_debug` to inspect Bazel's sandbox directory of a failed action.

---

```bash
bazel build //:mylib
bazel build //:hello
```

```bash
bazel build //:hello --subcommands --sandbox_debug
```

The `--sandbox_debug` flag makes Bazel **not** delete the created sandbox dirs after building, which is useful for debugging ([documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/command-line-reference.html#flag--sandbox_debug)).
It also prints some of these directories, which would be rather hard to find otherwise.

```bash
DIR=/home/jovyan/.cache/bazel/_bazel_jovyan/a97e5522e7ee0e7091ad348df8243be8/execroot/simple
find "$DIR" -iname '*mylib*'
find -L bazel-out -iname '*mylib*'
```
